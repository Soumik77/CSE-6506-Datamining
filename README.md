An Explainable, Lightweight Pipeline for Abusive-Language Detection (HateXplain)

Lightweight: subword FastText embeddings + DT/RF/ET + stacking
Explainable: LIME token-level rationales for any prediction
Robustness: word/character-level adversarial tests
Imbalanced data: SMOTE + careful curation
Full evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, MCC, Cohen’s κ with k-fold CV
Reproducible: scripts + fixed seeds + environment file
